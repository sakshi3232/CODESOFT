Repository for Internship tasks at CodSoft

Description : 
This repository showcase the Python-based projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft, ehich addressing distinct areas of Artificial Intelligence.

Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on some predefined rules.
Features :  
          - Utilizes if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.
          - Offers a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.


Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
An AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
Features :  
          - Implements the Minimax algorithm to make the AI player unbeatable.
          - Provides insights into game theory and basic search algorithms.


Task 3: Image Captioning
Combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI.
Features : 
          - Uses pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images.
          - Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.


Each project demonstrates practical applications of Python in Artificial Intelligence enhancing both technical skills and understanding of these domains.
